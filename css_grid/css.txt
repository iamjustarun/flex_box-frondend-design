/* Using Css Grid and FlexBox TI */
Using CSS Grid and Flexbox Together
Use Grid when
• You need full control of rows AND columns (examples: full page layouts, gallery items)
• You want to explicitly define the layout regardless of content size (i.e. if you are using

Flexbox and it starts to get really complicated with a bunch of heights and widths, you
probably should be using Grid)
Use Flexbox when...
• Your content is a row OR column (examples: horizontal navbar, vertical sidebar)
• You want the size of items to determine layout

justify-content:space-between
